# Dual-Channel-Beamformer
This project gives an example of dual microphone speech enhancement based on GSC beamformer and multiple channel postfilter. 

It is an implementation of the paper 'I. Cohen, Analysis of Two-Channel Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC) With Post-Filtering. IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing, 11(6), 684-699 (2003)'.

Note:The noise estimation part of IMCRA algorithm is based on the codes developed by Philipos C. Loizou et al.
